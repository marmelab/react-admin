# Upgrade to 3.0

## Increased version requirement for key dependencies

* `react` and `react-dom` are now required to be >= 16.8. This version is backward compatible with 16.3, which was the minimum requirement in react-admin, but it offers the support for Hooks.
* `react-redux` requires a minimum version of 7.1.0 (instead of 5.0). Check their upgrade guide for [6.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v6.0.0) and [7.0](https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v7.0.0)
* `redux-form` requires a minimum version of 8.2 (instead of 7.4). Check their [Upgrade guide](https://github.com/erikras/redux-form/releases/tag/v8.0.0).
* `material-ui` requires a minimum of 4.0.0 (instead of 1.5). Check their [Upgrade guide](https://next.material-ui.com/guides/migration-v3/).

## `react-router-redux` replaced by `connected-react-router`

We've replaced the `react-router-redux` package, which was deprecated and not compatible with the latest version of react-redux, by an equivalent package named `connected-react-router`. As they share the same API, you can just change the `import` statement and it should work fine.

```diff
-import { push } from 'react-router-redux';
+import { push } from 'connected-react-router';

-import { LOCATION_CHANGE } from 'react-router-redux';
+import { LOCATION_CHANGE } from 'connected-react-router';
```

It's a bit more work if you're using a Custom App, as the initialization of `connected-react-router` requires one more step than `react-router-redux`.

If you create a custom reducer, here is how to update your `createAdminStore` file:

```diff
import { applyMiddleware, combineReducers, compose, createStore } from 'redux';
-import { routerMiddleware, routerReducer } from 'react-router-redux';
+import { routerMiddleware, connectRouter } from 'connected-react-router';
import { reducer as formReducer } from 'redux-form';

...

export default ({
    authProvider,
    dataProvider,
    i18nProvider = defaultI18nProvider,
    history,
    locale = 'en',
}) => {
    const reducer = combineReducers({
        admin: adminReducer,
        i18n: i18nReducer(locale, i18nProvider(locale)),
        form: formReducer,
-       router: routerReducer,
+       router: connectRouter(history),
        { /* add your own reducers here */ },
    });

...
```

The syntax of the `routerMiddleware` doesn't change.

And if you don't use the `<Admin>` component, change the package for `ConnectedRouter`:

```diff
import React from 'react';
import { Provider } from 'react-redux';
import { createHashHistory } from 'history';
-import { ConnectedRouter } from 'react-router-redux';
+import { ConnectedRouter } from 'connected-react-router';
import { Switch, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import withContext from 'recompose/withContext';
...
```

## Resource context renamed to Resource intent

If you're using a Custom App, you had to render Resource components with the registration *context* prior to rendering your app routes. The `context` prop was renamed to `intent` because it conflicted with a prop injected by react-redux.

```diff
-               <Resource name="posts" context="registration" />
+               <Resource name="posts" intent="registration" />
-               <Resource name="comments" context="registration" />
+               <Resource name="comments" intent="registration" />
-               <Resource name="users" context="registration" />
+               <Resource name="users" intent="registration" />
```

## `withDataProvider` no longer injects `dispatch`

The `withDataProvider` HOC used to inject two props: `dataProvider`, and redux' `dispatch`. This last prop is now easy to get via the `useDispatch` hook from Redux, so `withDataProvider` no longer injects it.

```diff
import {
   showNotification,
   UPDATE,
   withDataProvider,
} from 'react-admin';
+ import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';

-const ApproveButton = ({ dataProvider, dispatch, record }) => {
+const ApproveButton = ({ dataProvider, record }) => {
+   const dispatch = withDispatch();
    const handleClick = () => {
        const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
        dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments', { id: record.id, data: updatedRecord })
            .then(() => {
                dispatch(showNotification('Comment approved'));
                dispatch(push('/comments'));
            })
            .catch((e) => {
                dispatch(showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning'))
            });
    }

    return <Button label="Approve" onClick={handleClick} />;
}

export default withDataProvider(ApproveButton);
```

## `<CardActions>` renamed to `<TopToolbar>`

The `<CardActions>` component, which used to wrap the action buttons in the `Edit`, `Show` and `Create` views, is now named `<TopToolbar>`. That's because actions aren't located inside the `Card` anymore, but above it.

```diff
import Button from '@material-ui/core/Button';
-import { CardActions, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';
+import { TopToolbar, ShowButton } from 'react-admin';

const PostEditActions = ({ basePath, data, resource }) => (
-   <CardActions>
+   <TopToolbar>
        <ShowButton basePath={basePath} record={data} />
        {/* Add your custom actions */}
        <Button color="primary" onClick={customAction}>Custom Action</Button>
-   </CardActions>
+   </TopToolbar>
);

export const PostEdit = (props) => (
    <Edit actions={<PostEditActions />} {...props}>
        ...
    </Edit>
);
```

But watch out, you can't just replace "CardActions" by "TopToolbar" in your entire codebase, because you probably also use Material-ui's `<CardActions>`, and that component still exists. The fact that react-admin exported a component with the same name but with a different look and feel than the material-iu component was also a motivation to rename it.
