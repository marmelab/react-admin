# react-admin

React-admin is a frontend framework for building browser-based, data-driven applications on top of REST/GraphQL APIs using [React](https://react.dev). Maintained by [marmelab](https://marmelab.com), it is open source and battle-tested.

[![react-admin-demo](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/img/react-admin-demo-still.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJEo1O1oT6o)

Check out examples of react-admin in action in the [Demos](./Demos.md) section.

## Features

- **Declarative UI**: Define your data views with simple React components.
- **Batteries Included**: Default CRUD screens, filters, data grids, forms, and navigation.
- **Customizable**: Swap out any part of the interface or data interaction.
- **Scalable**: From simple dashboards to complex enterprise applications.
- **Data Providers**: Easily integrate with REST, GraphQL, or custom APIs.
- **UI Agnostic**: React-admin offers an integration with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/) for a polished, consistent look, but you can use any UI library.

## Installation

Install react-admin from npm or yarn:

```sh
npm install react-admin
# or
yarn add react-admin
```

## Usage

Hereâ€™s a simple example:

```jsx
import * as React from "react";
import { createRoot } from "react-dom/client";
import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser, EditGuesser } from "react-admin";
import simpleRestProvider from "ra-data-simple-rest";

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(
  <Admin dataProvider={simpleRestProvider("http://localhost:3000")}>
    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} edit={EditGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);
```

This sets up an admin panel for managing "posts", with default CRUD routes:

- `/posts` shows a list view.
- `/posts/:id` allows editing an existing post.

React-admin will fetch data from `http://localhost:3000/posts`, and generate the UI based on the data structure. From there on, you can customize the UI and add more resources.

## API Integration

Does it work with your API? Yes. 

React-admin uses a *Data Provider* approach to connect to API backends. There are [more than 50 ready-made providers](./DataProviderList.md) for REST, GraphQL, and more, and you can [write your own custom provider](./DataProviderWriting.md) if needed.

See the [Data Providers Documentation](./DataProviders.md) for more details.

## Built for Flexibility

React-admin is modular. Replace any part you like: use a different data grid, integrate GraphQL instead of REST, or apply a custom theme. It's flexible to adapt to your needs.
