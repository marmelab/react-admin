## DataProvider

The included data provider use [ra-data-simple-rest](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-simple-rest). It fits REST APIs using simple GET parameters for filters and sorting. This is the dialect used for instance in [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest).

You'll find an `.env` file at the project root that includes a `VITE_JSON_SERVER_URL` variable. Set it to the URL of your backend.
