## DataProvider

The included data provider use [ra-data-json-server](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/packages/ra-data-json-server). It fits REST APIs powered by [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), such as [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).

You'll find an `.env` file at the project root that includes a `VITE_JSON_SERVER_URL` variable. Set it to the URL of your backend. By default, we set it to targets [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
