`canAccessWithPermissions` is a helper function that facilitates the implementation of [Access Control](./Permissions.md#access-control) policies based on an underlying list of user roles and permissions.

It is a builder block to implement the `authProvider.canAccess()` method,  which is called by ra-core to check whether the current user has the right to perform a given action on a given resource or record.

This feature requires a valid [Enterprise Edition](https://marmelab.com/ra-enterprise/) subscription.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save @react-admin/ra-core-ee
# or
yarn add @react-admin/ra-core-ee
```

## Usage

`canAccessWithPermissions` is a pure function that you can call from your `authProvider.canAccess()` implementation.

```tsx
import { canAccessWithPermissions } from '@react-admin/ra-core-ee';

const authProvider = {
    // ...
    canAccess: async ({ action, resource, record }) => {    
        const permissions = myGetPermissionsFunction();
        return canAccessWithPermissions({
            permissions,
            action,
            resource,
            record,
        });
    }
    // ...
};
```

The `permissions` parameter must be an array of permissions. A *permission* is an object that represents access to a subset of the application. It is defined by a `resource` (usually a noun) and an `action` (usually a verb), with sometimes an additional `record`.

Here are a few examples of permissions:

- `{ action: "*", resource: "*" }`: allow everything
- `{ action: "read", resource: "*" }`: allow read actions on all resources
- `{ action: "read", resource: ["companies", "people"] }`: allow read actions on a subset of resources
- `{ action: ["read", "create", "edit", "export"], resource: "companies" }`: allow all actions except delete on companies
- `{ action: ["write"], resource: "game.score", record: { "id": "123" } }`: allow write action on the score of the game with id 123

:::tip
When the `record` field is omitted, the permission is valid for all records.

In most cases, the permissions are derived from user roles, which are fetched at login and stored in memory or in localStorage. Check the [`getPermissionsFromRoles`](./getPermissionsFromRoles.md) function to merge the permissions from multiple roles into a single flat array of permissions.

## Parameters

This function takes an object as argument with the following fields:

| Name | Optional | Type | Description
| - | - | - | - |
| `permissions` | Required | `Array<Permission>` | An array of permissions for the current user
| `action` | Required | `string` | The action for which to check users has the execution right
| `resource` | Required | `string` | The resource for which to check users has the execution right
| `record` | Required | `string` | The record for which to check users has the execution right

`canAccessWithPermissions` expects the `permissions` to be a flat array of permissions. It is your responsibility to fetch these permissions (usually during login). If the permissions are spread into several role definitions, you can merge them into a single array using the [`getPermissionsFromRoles`](./getPermissionsFromRoles.md) function.

## Building RBAC

The following example shows how to implement Role-based Access Control (RBAC) in `authProvider.canAccess()` using `canAccessWithPermissions` and `getPermissionsFromRoles`. The role permissions are defined in the code, and the user roles are returned by the authentication endpoint. Additional user permissions can also be returned by the authentication endpoint.

The `authProvider` stores the permissions in `localStorage`, so that returning users can access their permissions without having to log in again.

```tsx
// in roleDefinitions.ts
export const roleDefinitions = {
    admin: [
        { action: '*', resource: '*' }
    ],
    reader: [
        { action: ['list', 'show', 'export'], resource: '*' },
        { action: 'read', resource: 'posts.*' },
        { action: 'read', resource: 'comments.*' },
    ],
    accounting: [
        { action: '*', resource: 'sales' },
    ],
};

// in authProvider.ts
import { canAccessWithPermissions, getPermissionsFromRoles } from '@react-admin/ra-core-ee';
import { roleDefinitions } from './roleDefinitions';

const authProvider = {
    login: async ({ username, password }) => {
        const request = new Request('https://mydomain.com/authenticate', {
            method: 'POST',
            body: JSON.stringify({ username, password }),
            headers: new Headers({ 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }),
        });
        const response = await fetch(request);
            if (response.status < 200 || response.status >= 300) {
                throw new Error(response.statusText);
            }
        const { user: { roles, permissions }} = await response.json();
        // merge the permissions from the roles with the extra permissions
        const permissions = getPermissionsFromRoles({
            roleDefinitions,
            userPermissions,
            userRoles
        });
        localStorage.setItem('permissions', JSON.stringify(permissions));
    },
    canAccess: async ({ action, resource, record }) => {    
        const permissions = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem('permissions'));
        return canAccessWithPermissions({
            permissions,
            action,
            resource,
            record,
        });
    }
    // ...
};
```
