# React-admin Simple Example

This is the application we use for our end-to-end tests, and for reproducing bugs via CodeSandbox.

## How to run

From the react-admin repository:

```sh
# install the dependencies for the monorepo
make install
# run the app in extended watch mode (reloads when a change is detected in the app code and in the packages code)
make run-simple
```

And then browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The credentials are **login/password**
