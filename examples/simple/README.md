# React-admin Simple Example

This is the application we use for our end to end tests, and for reproducing bugs via CodeSandbox.  

## How to run

If you're running this app standalone:

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn
# run the app in watch mode (reloads when a change is detected in the app code)
yarn dev
```

If you're in the react-admin repository:

```sh
# install the dependencies for the monorepo
make install
# run the app in extended watch mode (reloads when a change is detected in the app code and in the packages code)
make run-simple
```

And then browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

The credentials are **login/password**
