# React-admin Demo

This is a demo of the [react-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin) library for React.js. It creates a working administration for a fake poster shop named Posters Galore. You can test it online at https://marmelab.com/react-admin-demo.

React-admin usually requires a REST/GraphQL server to provide data. In this demo however, the API is simulated by the browser (using [FakeRest](https://github.com/marmelab/FakeRest)). The source data is generated at runtime by a package called [data-generator](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/examples/data-generator).

To explore the source code, start with [src/App.tsx](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/examples/demo/src/App.tsx).

**Note**: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## How to run

After having cloned the react-admin repository, run the following commands at the react-admin root:

```sh
make install

make build

make run-demo
```

## Run via Docker

To run the application using Docker:

1. Build the Docker image:
   ```sh
   docker build -t react-admin-demo .
   ```

2. Run the Docker container:
   ```sh
   docker run -p 3000:3000 react-admin-demo
   ```

3. Access the application at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](#running-tests) for more information.

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run deploy`

Deploy the build to GitHub gh-pages.
