In addition, the previous version of react-admin, called admin-on-rest, was translated into the following languages:

- Chinese (Traditional) (`cht`): [leesei/aor-language-chinese-traditional](https://github.com/leesei/aor-language-chinese-traditional)

- Thai (`th`): [liverbool/aor-language-thai](https://github.com/liverbool/aor-language-thai)

These packages are not directly interoperable with react-admin, but the upgrade is straightforward; rename the root key from "aor" to "ra". We invite the authors of the packages listed above to republish their translations for react-admin, using a different package name.

If you want to contribute a new translation, feel free to submit a pull request to update [this page](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/blob/master/docs/TranslationLocales.md) with a link to your package.
