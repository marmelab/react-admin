# Querying the API

Admin interfaces often have to query the API beyond CRUD requests. For instance, a user profile page may need to get the User object based on a user id. Or, users may want to an "Approve" a comment by pressing a button, and this action should update the `is_approved` property and save the updated record in one click.

React-admin provides special hooks to emit read and write queries to the `dataProvider`, which in turn sends requests to your API.

## `useQuery` Hook

Use the `useQuery` hook to emit a read query to the API when a component mounts. The parameters are the same as the ones expected by the [`dataProvider`](./DataProviders.md):

- `type`: The Query type, e.g `GET_LIST`
- `resource`: The Resource name, e.g. "posts"
- `params`: Query parameters. Depends on the query type.

The return value of `useQuery` is an object, which updates according to the request state:

- start: `{ loading: true, loaded: false }`
- success: `{ data: [data from response], total: [total from response], loading: false, loaded: true }`
- error: `{ error: [error from response], loading: false, loaded: true }`

Here is an implementation of a user profile component using the `useQuery` hook:

```jsx
import { useQuery, GET_ONE } from 'react-admin';

const UserProfile = ({ record }) => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(
        GET_ONE,
        'users',
        { id: record.id }
    );
    if (loading) { return <Loading />; }
    if (error) { return <p>ERROR</p>; }
    return <div>User {data.username}</div>;
};
```

Under the hood, `useQuery` dispatches a Redux action (named `CUSTOM_FETCH`), which triggers the global loading indicator in the top bar. This action then queries your `dataProvider`, passing it the exact same parameters.

In this example, the `dataProvider` receives a query for `('GET_ONE', 'users', { id: 123 })`. It should return a Promise for a response with a `data` key looking like `{ data: { id: 123, username: 'john_doe', firstName: 'John', lastName: 'Doe' } }`. That `data` ends up in the hook return value, and the loading indicator stops spinning.

Here is another example usage of `useQuery`, this time to display a list of users:

```jsx
import { useQuery, GET_LIST } from 'react-admin';

const UserList = () => {
    const { loading, error, data, total } = useQuery(
        GET_LIST,
        'users',
        {
            pagination: { page: 1, perPage: 10 },
            sort: { field: 'username', order: 'ASC' },
        }
    );
    if (loading) { return <Loading />; }
    if (error) { return <p>ERROR</p>; }
    return (
        <div>
            <p>Total users: {total}</p>
            <ul>
                {data.map(user => <li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>)}
            </ul>
        </div>
    );
};
```

As a reminder, here are the read query types handled by data providers:

Type                 | Usage                                           | Params format              | Response format
-------------------- | ------------------------------------------------|--------------------------- | ---------------
`GET_LIST`           | Search for resources                            | `{ pagination: { page: {int} , perPage: {int} }, sort: { field: {string}, order: {string} }, filter: {Object} }` | `{ data: {Record[]}, total: {int} }`
`GET_ONE`            | Read a single resource, by id                   | `{ id: {mixed} }`          | `{ data: {Record} }`
`GET_MANY`           | Read a list of resource, by ids                 | `{ ids: {mixed[]} }`       | `{ data: {Record[]} }`
`GET_MANY_REFERENCE` | Read a list of resources related to another one | `{ target: {string}, id: {mixed}, pagination: { page: {int} , perPage: {int} }, sort: { field: {string}, order: {string} }, filter: {Object} }`     | `{ data: {Record[]} }`

You can destructure the return value of the `useQuery` hook as `{ data, total, error, loading, loaded }`.

**Tip**: Your `dataProvider` should return the `total` value for list queries only, to express the total number of results (which may be higher than the number of returned results if the response is paginated). 

## `useMutation` Hook

`useQuery` emits the request to the `dataProvider` as soon as the component mounts. To emit the request based on a user action, use the `useMutation` hook instead. This hook returns a callback that emits the request when executed, and an object containing the request state:

- mount: { loading: false, loaded: false }
- mutate called: { loading: true, loaded: false }
- success: { data: [data from response], total: [total from response], loading: false, loaded: true }
- error: { error: [error from response], loading: false, loaded: true }

Here is an implementation of an "Approve" button:

```jsx
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import { useMutation, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const [approve, { loading }] = useMutation(
        UPDATE,
        'comments',
        { id: record.id, data: { isApproved: true } }
    );
    return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={approve} disabled={loading} />;
};
```

Under the hood, `useMutation` also dispatches a Redux `CUSTOM_FETCH` action, and takes care of showing the global loading indicator when the request is emitted.

User actions usually trigger write queries - that's why this hook is called `useMutation`. As a reminder, here are the write query types handled by data providers:

Type                 | Usage                     | Params format                             | Response format
-------------------- | --------------------------|------------------------------------------ | ---------------
`CREATE`             | Create a single resource  | `{ data: {Object} }`                      | `{ data: {Record} }`
`UPDATE`             | Update a single resource  | `{ id: {mixed}, data: {Object}, previousData: {Object} }` | `{ data: {Record} }`
`UPDATE_MANY`        | Update multiple resources | `{ ids: {mixed[]}, data: {Object} }`      | `{ data: {mixed[]} }` The ids which have been updated
`DELETE`             | Delete a single resource  | `{ id: {mixed}, previousData: {Object} }` | `{ data: {Record} }`
`DELETE_MANY`        | Delete multiple resources | `{ ids: {mixed[]} }`                      | `{ data: {mixed[]} }` The ids which have been deleted

You can destructure the return value of the `useMutation` hook as `[mutate,  { data, total, error, loading, loaded }]`.

This `ApproveButton` can be used right away, for instance in the list of comments, where `<Datagrid>` automatically injects the `record` to its children:

```jsx
// in src/comments/index.js
import ApproveButton from './ApproveButton';

export const CommentList = (props) =>
    <List {...props}>
        <Datagrid>
            <DateField source="created_at" />
            <TextField source="author.name" />
            <TextField source="body" />
            <BooleanField source="is_approved" />
            <ApproveButton />
        </Datagrid>
    </List>;
```

## Handling Side Effects

Fetching data is called a *side effect*, since it calls the outside world, and is asynchronous. Usual actions may have other side effects, like showing a notification, or redirecting the user to another page. Both `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks accept a fourth parameter, which lets you describe the options of the query, including success and failure side effects. 

Here is how to add notifications and a redirection to the `ApproveButton` component using that fourth parameter:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import { useMutation, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const [approve, { loading }] = useMutation(
        UPDATE,
        'comments',
        { id: record.id, data: { isApproved: true } },
+       {
+           onSuccess: {
+               notification: { body: 'Comment approved', level: 'info' },
+               redirectTo: '/comments',
+           },
+           onError: {
+               notification: { body: 'Error: comment not approved', level: 'warning' }
+           }
+       }
    );
    return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={approve} disabled={loading} />;
};
```

React-admin can handle the following side effects:

- `notification`: Display a notification. The property value should be an object describing the notification to display. The `body` can be a translation key. `level` can be either `info` or `warning`.
- `redirectTo`: Redirect the user to another page. The property value should be the path to redirect the user to.
- `refresh`: Force a rerender of the current view (equivalent to pressing the Refresh button). Set to true to enable.
- `unselectAll`: Unselect all lines in the current datagrid. Set to true to enable.
- `callback`: Execute an arbitrary function. The value should be the function to execute. React-admin will call the function with an object as parameter (`{ requestPayload, payload, error }`). The `payload` contains the decoded response body when it's successfull. When it's failed, the response body is passed in the `error`.
- `basePath`: This is not a side effect, but it's used internally to compute redirection paths. Set it when you have a redirection side effect.

## Optimistic Rendering and Undo

In the previous example, after clicking on the "Approve" button, a spinner displays while the data provider is fetched. Then, users are redirected to the comments list. But in most cases, the server returns a success response, so the user waits for this response for nothing.

For its own fetch actions, react-admin uses an approach called *optimistic rendering*. The idea is to handle the calls to the `dataProvider` on the client side first (i.e. updating entities in the Redux store), and re-render the screen immediately. The user sees the effect of their action with no delay. Then, react-admin applies the success side effects, and only after that, it triggers the call to the data provider. If the fetch ends with a success, react-admin does nothing more than a refresh to grab the latest data from the server. In most cases, the user sees no difference (the data in the Redux store and the data from the data provider are the same). If the fetch fails, react-admin shows an error notification, and forces a refresh, too.

As a bonus, while the success notification is displayed, users have the ability to cancel the action *before* the data provider is even called.

You can benefit from optimistic rendering when you call the `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks, too. You just need to pass the `undoable: true` option in the options parameter:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import { useMutation, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const [approve, { loading }] = useMutation(
        UPDATE,
        'comments',
        { id: record.id, data: { isApproved: true } },
        {
+           undoable: true,
            onSuccess: {
                notification: { body: 'Comment approved', level: 'info' },
                redirectTo: '/comments',
            },
            onError: {
                notification: { body: 'Error: comment not approved', level: 'warning' }
            }
        }
    );
    return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={approve} disabled={loading} />;
};
```

## `useDataProvider` Hook

Sometimes `useQuery` and `useMutation` are too limited, for instance when you need to execute several queries in a row, and update the component state when all the queries have returned. For this use case, use the `useDataProvider` hook, which returns a `dataProvider` callback. This callback behaves exactly like the raw `dataProvider`, except it uses Redux under the hood. That means that it returns a Promise for the result.

For instance, here is how to query for a list of pending reviews together with the author of each review:

```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import { useDataProvider, GET_LIST, GET_MANY } from 'react-admin';

const Dashboard = () => {
    const dataProvider = useDataProvider();
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
        (async function() { // useEffect doesn't accept async functions
            const { data: pendingReviews } = await dataProvider(
                GET_LIST,
                'reviews',
                { filter: { status: 'pending' }, sort: { field: 'date', order: 'DESC' } }
            );
            const customerIds = pendingReviews.map(review => review.customer_id);
            const uniqueCustomerIds = [...new Set(customerIds)];
            const { data: customers } = await dataProvider(
                GET_MANY,
                'customers',
                { ids: uniqueCustomerIds }
            );
            const customersById = customers.reduce((prev, customer) => {
                prev[customer.id] = customer;
                return prev;
            }, {});
            const pendingReviewsWithCustomers = pendingReviews.map(review => ({
                ...review,
                customer: customersById[review.customer_id]
            }))
            setReviews(pendingReviewsWithCustomers);
            setLoading(false);
        })();
    }, []);

    if (loading) { return <Loading />; }
    return (
        <div>
            {reviews.map(review => (
                <div key={review.id}>
                    Review on Product {review.product_id}
                    By {review.customer.username}:<br />
                    {review.body}
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    )
}
```

`useDataProvider` is more low-level than `useQuery` and `useMutation`, as it doesn't handle loading and error states (even though queries from `useDataProvider` trigger the global loading indicator). The `dataProvider` callback that it returns also accepts a fourth options parameter, just like the two other hoows.

## Legacy Components: `<Query>`, `<Mutation>`, and `withDataProvider`

Before react had hooks, react-admin used render props and higher order components to provide the same functionality. Legacy code will likely contain instances of `<Query>`, `<Mutation>`, and `withDataProvider`. Their syntax, which is identical to their hook counterpart, is illustrated below.

You can fetch and display a user profile using the `<Query>` component, which uses render props:

{% raw %}
```jsx
import { Query, GET_ONE } from 'react-admin';

const UserProfile = ({ record }) => (
    <Query type={GET_ONE} resource="users" payload={{ id: record.id }}>
        {({ data, loading, error }) => {
            if (loading) { return <Loading />; }
            if (error) { return <p>ERROR</p>; }
            return <div>User {data.username}</div>;
        }}
    </Query>
);
```
{% endraw %}

Or, query a user list on the dashboard with the same `<Query>` component:

```jsx
import { Query, GET_LIST } from 'react-admin';

const payload = {
   pagination: { page: 1, perPage: 10 },
   sort: { field: 'username', order: 'ASC' },
};

const UserList = () => (
    <Query type={GET_LIST} resource="users" payload={payload}>
        {({ data, total, loading, error }) => {
            if (loading) { return <Loading />; }
            if (error) { return <p>ERROR</p>; }
            return (
                <div>
                    <p>Total users: {total}</p>
                    <ul>
                        {data.map(user => <li key={user.username}>{user.username}</li>)}
                    </ul>
                </div>
            );
        }}
    </Query>
);
```

Just like `useQuery`, the `<Query>` component expects three parameters: `type`, `resource`, and `payload`. It fetches the data provider on mount, and passes the data to its child component once the response from the API arrives.

And if you need to chain API calls, don't hesitate to nest `<Query>` components.

When calling the API to update ("mutate") data, use the `<Mutation>` component instead. It passes a callback to trigger the API call to its child function. 

Here is a version of the `<ApproveButton>` component demonstrating `<Mutation>`:

```jsx
import { Mutation, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

const options = {
    undoable: true,
    onSuccess: {
        notification: { body: 'Comment approved', level: 'info' },
        redirectTo: '/comments',
    },
    onError: {
        notification: { body: 'Error: comment not approved', level: 'warning' }
    }
};

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const payload = { id: record.id, data: { ...record, is_approved: true } };
    return (
        <Mutation
            type={UPDATE}
            resource="comments"
            payload={payload}
            options={options}
        >
            {(approve, { loading }) => (
                <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={approve} disabled={loading} />
            )}
        </Mutation>
    );
}

export default ApproveButton;
```

And here is the `<Dashboard>` component using the `withDataProvider` HOC instead of the `useProvider` hook:

```diff
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
-import { useDataProvider, GET_LIST, GET_MANY } from 'react-admin';
+import { wihtDataProvider, GET_LIST, GET_MANY } from 'react-admin';

-const Dashboard = () => {
+const Dashboard = ({ dataProvider }) => {
-   const dataProvider = useDataProvider();
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(true);
    const [reviews, setReviews] = useState([]);
    useEffect(() => {
        (async function() { // useEffect doesn't accept async functions
            const { data: pendingReviews } = await dataProvider(
                GET_LIST,
                'reviews',
                { filter: { status: 'pending' }, sort: { field: 'date', order: 'DESC' } }
            );
            // ...
        })();
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>
            {reviews.map(review => (
                <div key={review.id}>
                    Review on Product {review.product_id}
                    By {review.customer.username}:<br />
                    {review.body}
                </div>
            ))}
        </div>
    )
}

-export default Dashboard;
+export default withDataProvider(Dashboard);
```

Note that these components are implemented in react-admin using the hooks described earlier. If you're writing new components, prefer the hooks, which are faster, and do not pollute the component tree.

## Querying The API With `fetch`

`useQuery`, `useMutation` and `useDataProvider` are "the react-admin way" to query the API, but nothing prevents you from using `fetch` if you want. For instance, when you don't want to add some routing logic to the data provider for a RPC method on your API, that makes perfect sense.

There is no special react-admin sauce in that case. Here is an example implementation of calling `fetch` in a component:

```jsx
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { useDispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { showNotification, fetchStart, fetchEnd } from 'react-admin';
import { push } from 'connected-react-router';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const [loading, setLoading] = useState(false;)
    const handleClick = () => {
        setLoading(true);
        dispatch(fetchStart()); // start the global loading indicator 
        const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
        fetch(`/comments/${record.id}`, { method: 'PUT', body: updatedRecord })
            .then(() => {
                dispatch(showNotification('Comment approved'));
                dispatch(push('/comments'));
            })
            .catch((e) => {
                dispatch(showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning'))
            })
            .finally(() => {
                setLoading(false);
                dispatch(fetchEnd()); // stop the global loading indicator
            });
    }

    return <Button label="Approve" onClick={handleClick} disabled={loading} />;
}

export default ApproveButton;
```

If you use `fetch`, you'll have to handle side effects on your own using Redux actions, as shown in this example.

`showNotification` and `push` are *action creators*. This is a Redux term for functions that return a simple action object. 

**TIP**: APIs often require a bit of HTTP plumbing to deal with authentication, query parameters, encoding, headers, etc. It turns out you probably already have a function that maps from a REST request to an HTTP request: your [Data Provider](./DataProviders.md). So it's often better to use `useDataProvider` instead of `fetch`.

## Using a Custom Action Creator 

In some rare cases, several components may share the same data fetching logic. In these cases, you will probably want to extract that logic into a custom Redux action. 

Warning: This is for advanced use cases only, and it requires a good level of understanding of Redux and react-admin internals. In most cases, `useDataProvider` is enough.

First, extract the request into a custom action creator. Use the dataProvider verb (`UPDATE`) as the `fetch` meta, pass the resource name as the `resource` meta, and pass the request parameters as the action `payload`:

```jsx
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: { fetch: UPDATE, resource: 'comments' },
});
```

Upon dispatch, this action will trigger the call to `dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments', { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true })`, dispatch a `COMMENT_APPROVE_LOADING` action, then after receiving the response, dispatch either a `COMMENT_APPROVE_SUCCESS`, or a `COMMENT_APPROVE_FAILURE`.

To use the new action creator in the component, `dispatch` it:

```jsx
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import { dispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { commentApprove } from './commentActions';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const handleClick = () => {
        dispatch(commentApprove(record.id, record));
        // how about push and showNotification?
    }
    return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Approve</Button>;
}

export default ApproveButton;
```

It works fine: when a user presses the "Approve" button, the API receives the `UPDATE` call, and that approves the comment. Another added benefit of using custom actions with the `fetch` meta is that react-admin automatically handles the loading state, so you don't need to mess up with `fetchStart()` and `fetchEnd()` manually.

But it's not possible to call `push` or `showNotification` in `handleClick` anymore. This is because `commentApprove()` returns immediately, whether the API call succeeds or not. How can you run a function only when the action succeeds?

## Adding Side Effects to Actions

Just like for the `useDataProvider` hook, you can associate side effects to a fetch action declaratively by setting the appropriate keys in the action `meta`.

So the side effects will be declared in the action creator rather than in the component. For instance, to display a notification when the `COMMENT_APPROVE` action is successfully dispatched, add the `notification` meta:

```diff
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        fetch: UPDATE,
+       onSuccess: {
+           notification: {
+               body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
+               level: 'info',
+           },
+           redirectTo: '/comments',
+           basePath,
+       },
+       onFailure: {
+           notification: {
+               body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_failure',
+               level: 'warning',
+           },
+       },
    },
});
```

The side effects accepted in the `meta` field of the action are the same as in the fourth parameter of the function returned by `useQuery`, `useMutation`, or `withDataProvider`:

- `notification`: Display a notification. The property value should be an object describing the notification to display. The `body` can be a translation key. `level` can be either `info` or `warning`.
- `redirectTo`: Redirect the user to another page. The property value should be the path to redirect the user to.
- `refresh`: Force a rerender of the current view (equivalent to pressing the Refresh button). Set to true to enable.
- `unselectAll`: Unselect all lines in the current datagrid. Set to true to enable.
- `callback`: Execute an arbitrary function. The value should be the function to execute. React-admin will call the function with an object as parameter (`{ requestPayload, payload, error }`). The `payload` contains the decoded response body when it's successfull. When it's failed, the response body is passed in the `error`.
- `basePath`: This is not a side effect, but it's used internally to compute redirection paths. Set it when you have a redirection side effect.

## Making An Action Undoable

when using the `useMutation` hook, you could trigger optimistic rendering and get an undo button for free. The same feature is possible using custom actions. You need to decorate the action with the `startUndoable` action creator:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import { dispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { commentApprove } from './commentActions';
+import { startUndoable } from 'react-admin';

const ApproveButton = ({ record }) => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    const handleClick = () => {
-       dispatch(commentApprove(record.id, record));
+       dispatch(startUndoable(commentApprove(record.id, record)));
    }
    return <Button onClick={handleClick}>Approve</Button>;
}

export default ApproveButton;
```

And that's all it takes to make a fetch action optimistic.

## Altering the Form Values before Submitting

Sometimes, you may want your custom action to alter the form values before actually sending them to the `dataProvider`. For those cases, you should know that every buttons inside a form [Toolbar](/CreateEdit.md#toolbar) receive two props:

- `handleSubmitWithRedirect` which calls the default form save methods
- `handleSubmit` which is the same prop as in [`react-form`](https://redux-form.com/7.4.2/docs/api/props.md/#-code-handlesubmit-eventorsubmit-function-code-)

Knowing this, you can dispatch a custom action with a button and still benefit from the default crud action side effects (notifications, optimistic ui, undo, etc.). For instance, in the `simple` example:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { dispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { crudCreate, SaveButton, Toolbar } from 'react-admin';

// A custom action creator which modifies the values before calling the default crudCreate action creator
const addComment = (values, basePath, redirectTo) =>
    crudCreate('posts', { ...values, average_note: 10 }, basePath, redirectTo);

const SaveWithNoteButtonView = ({ handleSubmitWithRedirect, ...props }) => {
    const handleClick = () => {
        const { basePath, handleSubmit, redirect } = props;
        return handleSubmit(values => {
            dispatch(addComment(values, basePath, redirect));
        });
    };

    return (
        <SaveButton
            handleSubmitWithRedirect={handleClick}
            {...props}
        />
    );
}
```

This button can be used in the `PostCreateToolbar` component:

```jsx
const PostCreateToolbar = props => (
    <Toolbar {...props}>
        <SaveButton
            label="post.action.save_and_show"
            redirect="show"
            submitOnEnter={true}
        />
        <SaveWithNoteButton
            label="post.action.save_with_average_note"
            redirect="show"
            submitOnEnter={false}
            variant="text"
        />
    </Toolbar>
);
```

## Custom Side Effects

Sometimes, you may want to trigger other *side effects* - like closing a popup window, or sending a message to an analytics server. The easiest way to achieve this is to use the `callback` side effect:

```diff
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        fetch: UPDATE,
        onSuccess: {
            notification: {
                body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
                level: 'info',
            },
            redirectTo: '/comments',
+           callback: ({ payload, requestPayload }) => { /* your own logic */ }
            basePath,
        },
        onFailure: {
            notification: {
                body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_failure',
                level: 'warning',
            },
+           callback: ({ payload, requestPayload }) => { /* your own logic */ }
        },
    },
});
```

Under the hood, `useDataProvider` uses the `callback` side effect to provide a Promise interface for dispatching fetch actions. As chaining custom side effects will quickly lead you to callback hell, we recommend that you use the `callback` side effect sparingly.

## Custom Sagas

React-admin promotes a programming style where side effects are decoupled from the rest of the code, which has the benefit of making them testable.

In react-admin, side effects are handled by Sagas. [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/) is a side effect library built for Redux, where side effects are defined by generator functions. If this is new to you, take a few minutes to go through the Saga documentation.

Here is the generator function necessary to handle the side effects for a failed `COMMENT_APPROVE` action which would log the error with an external service such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io):

```jsx
// in src/comments/commentSaga.js
import { call, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

function* commentApproveFailure({ error }) {
    yield call(Raven.captureException, error);
}

export default function* commentSaga() {
    yield takeEvery('COMMENT_APPROVE_FAILURE', commentApproveFailure);
}
```

Let's explain all of that, starting with the final `commentSaga` generator function. A [generator function](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_generators.html) (denoted by the `*` in the function name) gets paused on statements called by `yield` - until the yielded statement returns. `yield takeEvery([ACTION_NAME], callback)` executes the provided callback [every time the related action is called](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/basics/UsingSagaHelpers.html). To summarize, this will execute `commentApproveFailure` when the fetch initiated by `commentApprove()` fails.

As for `commentApproveFailure`, it just dispatch a [`call`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#callfn-args) side effect to the `captureException` function from the global `Raven` object.

To use this saga, pass it in the `customSagas` props of the `<Admin>` component:

```jsx
// in src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';

import { CommentList } from './comments';
import commentSaga from './comments/commentSaga';

const App = () => (
    <Admin customSagas={[ commentSaga ]} dataProvider={jsonServerProvider('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')}>
        <Resource name="comments" list={CommentList} />
    </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

With this code, a failed review approval now sends the the correct signal to Sentry.

**Tip**:  The side effects are [testable](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html#making-our-code-testable), too.

## Using a Custom Reducer

In addition to triggering REST calls, you may want to store the effect of your own actions in the application state. For instance, if you want to display a widget showing the current exchange rate for the bitcoin, you might need the following action:

```jsx
// in src/bitcoinRateReceived.js
export const BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED = 'BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED';
export const bitcoinRateReceived = (rate) => ({
    type: BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED,
    payload: { rate },
});
```

This action can be triggered on mount by the following component:

```jsx
// in src/BitCoinRate.js
import React from 'react';
import { dispatch } from 'react-redux';
import { bitcoinRateReceived } from './bitcoinRateReceived';

const BitCoinRate = ({ rate }) => {
    const dispatch = useDispatch();
    useEffect(() => {
        fetch('https://blockchain.info/fr/ticker')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(rates => rates.USD['15m'])
            .then(() => dispatch(bitcoinRateReceived(rate))) // dispatch action when the response is received
    }, []);

    return <div>Current bitcoin value: {rate}$</div>
}

export default BitCoinRate;
```

In order to put the rate passed to `bitcoinRateReceived()` into the Redux store, you'll need a reducer:

```jsx
// in src/rateReducer.js
import { BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED } from './bitcoinRateReceived';

export default (previousState = 0, { type, payload }) => {
    if (type === BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED) {
        return payload.rate;
    }
    return previousState;
}
```

Now the question is: How can you put this reducer in the `<Admin>` app? Simple: use the `customReducers` props:

{% raw %}
```jsx
// in src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Admin } from 'react-admin';

import rate from './rateReducer';

const App = () => (
    <Admin customReducers={{ rate }} dataProvider={jsonServerProvider('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')}>
        ...
    </Admin>
);

export default App;
```
{% endraw %}

**Tip**: You can avoid storing data in the Redux state by storing data in a component state instead. It's much less complicated to deal with, and more performant, too. Use the global state only when you need to access data from several components which are far away in the application tree.

## List Bulk Actions

Almost everything we saw before about custom actions is true for custom `List` bulk action buttons too, with the following few differences:

* Bulk action button components receive the following props: `resource`, `selectedIds` and `filterValues`
* They do not receive the current record in the `record` prop as there are many of them.

You can find a complete example of a custom Bulk Action button in the `List` documentation, in the [Bulk Action Buttons](/List.html#bulk-action-buttons) section.
