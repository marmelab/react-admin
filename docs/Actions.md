# Writing Actions

Admin interfaces often have to offer custom actions, beyond the simple CRUD. For instance, in an administration for comments, an "Approve" button (allowing to update the `is_approved` property and to save the updated record in one click) - is a must have.

How can you add such custom actions with react-admin? The answer is twofold, and learning to do it properly will give you a better understanding of how react-admin uses Redux and redux-saga.

## The Simple Way

Here is an implementation of the "Approve" button that works perfectly:

```jsx
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import FlatButton from '@material-ui/core/FlatButton';
import { showNotification } from 'react-admin';
import { push } from 'react-router-redux';

class ApproveButton extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
        const { push, record, showNotification } = this.props;
        const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
        fetch(`/comments/${record.id}`, { method: 'PUT', body: updatedRecord })
            .then(() => {
                showNotification('Comment approved');
                push('/comments');
            })
            .catch((e) => {
                console.error(e);
                showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning')
            });
    }

    render() {
        return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}

ApproveButton.propTypes = {
    push: PropTypes.func,
    record: PropTypes.object,
    showNotification: PropTypes.func,
};

export default connect(null, {
    showNotification,
    push,
})(ApproveButton);
```

The `handleClick` function makes a `PUT` request the REST API with `fetch`, then displays a notification (with `showNotification`) and redirects to the comments list page (with `push`);

`showNotification` and `push` are *action creators*. This is a Redux term for functions that return a simple action object. When given an object of action creators in the second argument, `connect()` will [decorate each action creator](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux/blob/master/docs/api.md#connectmapstatetoprops-mapdispatchtoprops-mergeprops-options) with Redux' `dispatch` method, so in the `handleClick` function, a call to `showNotification()` is actually a call to `dispatch(showNotification())`.

This `ApproveButton` can be used right away, for instance in the list of comments, where `<Datagrid>` automatically injects the `record` to its children:

```jsx
// in src/comments/index.js
import ApproveButton from './ApproveButton';

export const CommentList = (props) =>
    <List {...props}>
        <Datagrid>
            <DateField source="created_at" />
            <TextField source="author.name" />
            <TextField source="body" />
            <BooleanField source="is_approved" />
            <ApproveButton />
        </Datagrid>
    </List>;
```

Or, in the `<Edit>` page, as a [custom action](./CreateEdit.html#actions):

```jsx
// in src/comments/CommentEditActions.js
import React from 'react';
import CardActions from '@material-ui/core/CardActions';
import { ListButton, DeleteButton } from 'react-admin';
import ApproveButton from './ApproveButton';

const cardActionStyle = {
    zIndex: 2,
    display: 'inline-block',
    float: 'right',
};

const CommentEditActions = ({ basePath, data, resource }) => (
    <CardActions style={cardActionStyle}>
        <ApproveButton record={data} />
        <ListButton basePath={basePath} />
        <DeleteButton basePath={basePath} record={data} resource={resource} />
    </CardActions>
);

export default CommentEditActions;

// in src/comments/index.js
import CommentEditActions from './CommentEditActions';

export const CommentEdit = (props) =>
    <Edit {...props} actions={<CommentEditActions />}>
        ...
    </Edit>;
```

## Using a Data Provider Instead of Fetch

The previous code uses `fetch()`, which means it has to make raw HTTP requests. The REST logic often requires a bit of HTTP plumbing to deal with authentication, query parameters, encoding, headers, etc. It turns out you probably already have a function that maps from a REST request to an HTTP request: the [Data Provider](./DataProviders.html). So it's a good idea to use this function instead of `fetch` - provided you have exported it:

```jsx
// in src/dataProvider.js
import jsonServerProvider from 'ra-data-json-server';
export default jsonServerProvider('http://Mydomain.com/api/');
```

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
-import { showNotification } from 'react-admin';
+import { showNotification, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
+import dataProvider from '../dataProvider';

class ApproveButton extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
        const { push, record, showNotification } = this.props;
        const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
-       fetch(`/comments/${record.id}`, { method: 'PUT', body: updatedRecord })
-           .then(() => {
-               showNotification('Comment approved');
-               push('/comments');
-           })
-           .catch((e) => {
-               console.error(e);
-               showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning')
-           });
+       dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments', { id: record.id, data: updatedRecord })
+           .then(() => {
+               showNotification('Comment approved');
+               push('/comments');
+           })
+           .catch((e) => {
+               console.error(e);
+               showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning')
+           });
    }

    render() {
        return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}
```

There you go: no more `fetch`. Just like `fetch`, the `dataProvider` returns a `Promise`. It's signature is:

```jsx
/**
 * Query a data provider and return a promise for a response
 *
 * @example
 * dataProvider(GET_ONE, 'posts', { id: 123 })
 *  => new Promise(resolve => resolve({ id: 123, title: "hello, world" }))
 *
 * @param {string} type Request type, e.g GET_LIST
 * @param {string} resource Resource name, e.g. "posts"
 * @param {Object} payload Request parameters. Depends on the action type
 * @returns {Promise} the Promise for a response
 */
const dataProvider = (type, resource, params) => new Promise();
```

As for the syntax of the various request types (`GET_LIST`, `GET_ONE`, `UPDATE`, etc.), head to the [Data Provider documentation](./DataProviders.html#request-format) for more details.

## Triggering The Loading Indicator

Fetching data with `fetch` or the `dataProvider` right inside the component is easy. But it has one drawback: while the request is being processed by the server, the UI doesn't show the loading indicator.

React-admin keeps track of the number of pending XHR requests in its internal state. The main spinner (on the top app bar) shows up when there is at least one pending request. You can increase or decrease the number of pending requests by hand by using the `fetchStart()` and `fetchEnd()` action creators, as follows:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
-import { showNotification, UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
+import { 
+   showNotification, 
+   fetchStart,
+   fetchEnd,
+   UPDATE
+} from 'react-admin';

class ApproveButton extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
-       const { push, record, showNotification } = this.props;
+       const { push, record, showNotification, fetchStart, fetchEnd } = this.props;
        const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
+       fetchStart();
        dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments', { id: record.id, data: updatedRecord })
            .then(() => {
                showNotification('Comment approved');
                push('/comments');
            })
            .catch((e) => {
                console.error(e);
                showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning')
-           });
+           })
+           .finally(fetchEnd);
    }

    render() {
        return <FlatButton label="Approve" onClick={this.handleClick} />;
    }
}

ApproveButton.propTypes = {
+   fetchStart: PropTypes.func,
+   fetchEnd: PropTypes.func,
    push: PropTypes.func,
    record: PropTypes.object,
    showNotification: PropTypes.func,
};

export default connect(null, {
    showNotification,
+   fetchStart,
+   fetchEnd,
    push,
})(ApproveButton);
```

That solution is perfectly all right from a UI perspective, but also a bit verbose. Fortunately, react-admin uses and provides a shorter way to make HTTP requests in a component.

## Using a Custom Action Creator

React-admin components don't call the `dataProvider` directly. Instead, they dispatch a Redux action with the `fetch` meta. React-admin watches this kind of actions, turns them into `dataProvider` calls, and handles the loading state automatically. You can use the same feature for your own actions.

First, extract the request into a custom action creator. Use the dataProvider verb (`UPDATE`) as the `fetch` meta, pass the resource name as the `resource` meta, and pass the request parameters as the action `payload`:

```jsx
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';

export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: { fetch: UPDATE, resource: 'comments' },
});
```

Upon dispatch, this action will trigger the call to `dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments')`, dispatch a `COMMENT_APPROVE_LOADING` action, then after receiving the response, dispatch either a `COMMENT_APPROVE_SUCCESS`, or a `COMMENT_APPROVE_FAILURE`.

To use the new action creator in the component, `connect` it:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
-import { 
-   showNotification, 
-   fetchStart,
-   fetchEnd,
-   UPDATE
-} from 'react-admin';
+import { commentApprove } from './commentActions';

class ApproveButton extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
-       const { push, record, showNotification, fetchStart, fetchEnd } = this.props;
+       const { commentApprove, record } = this.props;
-       const updatedRecord = { ...record, is_approved: true };
-       fetchStart();
-       dataProvider(UPDATE, 'comments', { id: record.id, data: updatedRecord })
-           .then(() => {
-               showNotification('Comment approved');
-               push('/comments');
-           })
-           .catch((e) => {
-               console.error(e);
-               showNotification('Error: comment not approved', 'warning')
-           })
-           .finally(fetchEnd);
+       commentApprove(record.id, record);
+       // how about push and showNotification?
    }

    render() {
        return <Button onClick={this.handleClick}>Approve</Button>;
    }
}

ApproveButton.propTypes = {
-   fetchStart: PropTypes.func,
-   fetchEnd: PropTypes.func,
-   push: PropTypes.func,
-   showNotification: PropTypes.func,
+   commentApprove: PropTypes.func.isRequired,,
    record: PropTypes.object,
};

export default connect(null, {
-   showNotification,
-   fetchStart,
-   fetchEnd,
-   push,
+   commentApprove
})(ApproveButton);
```

That's way shorter, and easier to read. And it works fine: when a user presses the "Approve" button, the API receives the `UPDATE` call, and that approves the comment. Another added benefit of using custom actions with the `fetch` meta is that react-admin automatically handles the loading state, so you don't need to mess up with `fetchStart()` and `fetchEnd()` manually.

But it's not possible to call `push` or `showNotification` in `handleClick` anymore. This is because `commentApprove()` returns immediately, whether the API call succeeds or not. How can you run a function only when the action succeeds?

## Handling Side Effects

Fetching data is called a *side effect*, since it calls the outside world, and is asynchronous. Usual actions may have other side effects, like showing a notification, or redirecting the user to another page. Just like for the `fetch` side effect, you can associate side effects to an action declaratively by setting the appropriate keys in the action `meta`. 

So the side effects will be declared in the action creator rather than in the component. For instance, to display a notification when the `COMMENT_APPROVE` action is dispatched, add the `notification` meta:

```diff
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        fetch: UPDATE,
+       notification: {
+           body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
+           level: 'info',
+       },
+       redirectTo: '/comments',
+       basePath,
    },
});
```

React-admin can handle the following side effects metas:

- `notification`: Display a notification. The property value should be an object describing the notification to display. The `body` can be a translation key. `level` can be either `info` or `warning`.
- `redirectTo`: Redirect the user to another page. The property value should be the path to redirect the user to.
- `refresh`: Force a rerender of the current view (equivalent to pressing the Refresh button). Set to true to enable.
- `unselectAll`: Unselect all lines in the current datagrid. Set to true to enable.
- `callback`: Execute an arbitrary function. The meta value should be the function to execute. It receives the `requestPayload` and the response `payload`.
- `basePath`: This is not a side effect, but it's used internaly to compute redirection paths. Set it when you have a redirection side effect.

## Success and Failure Side Effects

React-admin triggers all side effects declared in the `meta` property of an action *simultaneously*. So in the previous example, the "notification approved" notification appears when the `COMMENT_APPROVE` action is dispatched, i.e. *before* the server is even called. That's a bit too early: what if the server returns an error?

In practice, most side effects must be triggered only after the `fetch` side effect succeeds or fails. To support that, you can enclose side effects under the `onSuccess` and `onFailure` keys in the `meta` property of an action:

```diff
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        fetch: UPDATE,
-       notification: {
-           body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
-           level: 'info',
-       },
-       redirectTo: '/comments',
-       basePath,
+       onSuccess: {
+           notification: {
+               body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
+               level: 'info',
+           },
+           redirectTo: '/comments',
+           basePath,
+       },
+       onFailure: {
+           notification: {
+               body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_failure',
+               level: 'warning',
+           },
+       },
    },
});
```

In this case, no side effect is triggered when the `COMMENT_APPROVE` action is dispatched. However, when the `fetch` side effects returns successfully, react-admin dispatches a `COMMENT_APPROVE_SUCCESS` action, and copies the `onSuccess` side effects into the `meta` property. So it will dispatch an action looking like:

```js
{
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE_SUCCESS,
    payload: { data: { /* data returned by the server */ } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        notification: {
            body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
            level: 'info',
        },
        redirectTo: '/comments',
        basePath,
    },
}
```

And then, the side effects will trigger. With this code, approving a review now displays the correct notification, and redirects to the comment list.

You can use `onSuccess` and `onFailure` metas in your own actions to handle side effects - that's the recommended way.

## Optimistic Rendering and Undo

In the previous example, after clicking on the "Approve" button, a spinner displays while the data provider is fetched. Then, users are redirected to the comments list. But in most cases, the server returns a success response, so the user waits for this response for nothing. 

For its own fetch actions, react-admin uses an approach called *optimistic rendering*. The idea is to handle the `fetch` actions on the client side first (i.e. updating entities in the Redux store), and re-render the screen immediately. The user sees the effect of their action with no delay. Then, react-admin applies the success side effects, and only after that, it triggers the call to the data provider. If the fetch ends with a success, react-admin does nothing more than a refresh to grab the latest data from the server. In most cases, the user sees no difference (the data in the Redux store and the data from the data provider are the same). If the fetch fails, react-admin shows an error notification, and forces a refresh, too.

As a bonus, while the success notification is displayed, users have the ability to cancel the action *before* the data provider is even called.

You can benefit from optimistic rendering in your own custom actions, too. You just need to decorate the action with the `startUndoable` action creator:

```diff
// in src/comments/ApproveButton.js
+import { startUndoable as startUndoableAction } from 'ra-core';
-import { commentApprove as commentApproveAction } from './commentActions';
+import { commentApprove } from './commentActions';

class ApproveButton extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
-       const { commentApprove, record } = this.props;
-       commentApprove(record.id, record);
+       const { startUndoable, record } = this.props;
+       startUndoable(commentApprove(record.id, record));
    }

    render() {
        return <Button onClick={this.handleClick}>Approve</Button>;
    }
}

ApproveButton.propTypes = {
-   commentApprove: PropTypes.func,
+   startUndoable: PropTypes.func,
    record: PropTypes.object,
};

export default connect(null, {
-   commentApprove: commentApproveAction,
+   startUndoable: startUndoableAction,
})(ApproveButton);
```

And that's all it takes to make a fetch action optimistic. Note that the `startUndoable` action creator is passed to Redux `connect` as `mapDispatchToProp`, to be decorated with `dispatch` - but `commentApprove` is not. Only the first action must be decorated with dispatch.

The fact that react-admin updates the internal store if you use custom actions with the `fetch` meta should be another motivation to avoid using raw `fetch`.

## Altering the Form Values before Submitting

Sometimes, you may want your custom action to alter the form values before actually sending them to the `dataProvider`. For those cases, you should know that every buttons inside a form [Toolbar](/CreateEdit.html#toolbar) receive two props:

- `handleSubmitWithRedirect` which calls the default form save methods
- `handleSubmit` which is the same prop as in [`react-form`](https://redux-form.com/7.4.2/docs/api/props.md/#-code-handlesubmit-eventorsubmit-function-code-)

Knowing this, you can dispatch a custom action with a button and still benefit from the default crud action side effects (notifications, optimistic ui, undo, etc.). For instance, in the `simple` example:

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { crudCreate, SaveButton, Toolbar } from 'react-admin';

// A custom action creator which modifies the values before calling the default crudCreate action creator
const saveWithNote = (values, basePath, redirectTo) =>
    crudCreate('posts', { ...values, average_note: 10 }, basePath, redirectTo);

class SaveWithNoteButtonView extends Component {
    handleClick = () => {
        const { basePath, handleSubmit, redirect, saveWithNote } = this.props;

        return handleSubmit(values => {
            saveWithNote(values, basePath, redirect);
        });
    };

    render() {
        const { handleSubmitWithRedirect, saveWithNote, ...props } = this.props;

        return (
            <SaveButton
                handleSubmitWithRedirect={this.handleClick}
                {...props}
            />
        );
    }
}

const SaveWithNoteButton = connect(
    undefined,
    { saveWithNote }
)(SaveWithNoteButtonView);
```

This button can be used in the `PostCreateToolbar` component:

```jsx
const PostCreateToolbar = props => (
    <Toolbar {...props}>
        <SaveButton
            label="post.action.save_and_show"
            redirect="show"
            submitOnEnter={true}
        />
        <SaveWithNoteButton
            label="post.action.save_with_average_note"
            redirect="show"
            submitOnEnter={false}
            variant="flat"
        />
    </Toolbar>
);
```

## Custom Sagas

Sometimes, you may want to trigger other *side effects* - like closing a popup window, or sending a message to an analytics server. The easiest way to achieve this is to use the `callback` side effect:

```diff
// in src/comment/commentActions.js
import { UPDATE } from 'react-admin';
export const COMMENT_APPROVE = 'COMMENT_APPROVE';
export const commentApprove = (id, data, basePath) => ({
    type: COMMENT_APPROVE,
    payload: { id, data: { ...data, is_approved: true } },
    meta: {
        resource: 'comments',
        fetch: UPDATE,
        onSuccess: {
            notification: {
                body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_success',
                level: 'info',
            },
            redirectTo: '/comments',
+           callback: ({ payload, requestPayload }) => { /* your own logic */ }
            basePath,
        },
        onFailure: {
            notification: {
                body: 'resources.comments.notification.approved_failure',
                level: 'warning',
            },
+           callback: ({ payload, requestPayload }) => { /* your own logic */ }
        },
    },
});
```

However, react-admin promotes a programming style where side effects are decoupled from the rest of the code, which has the benefit of making them testable.

In react-admin, side effects are handled by Sagas. [Redux-saga](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/) is a side effect library built for Redux, where side effects are defined by generator functions. If this is new to you, take a few minutes to go through the Saga documentation. 

Here is the generator function necessary to handle the side effects for a failed `COMMENT_APPROVE` action which would log the error with an external service such as [Sentry](https://sentry.io):

```jsx
// in src/comments/commentSaga.js
import { call, takeEvery } from 'redux-saga/effects';

function* commentApproveFailure({ error }) {
    yield call(Raven.captureException, error);
}

export default function* commentSaga() {
    yield takeEvery('COMMENT_APPROVE_FAILURE', commentApproveFailure);
}
```

Let's explain all of that, starting with the final `commentSaga` generator function. A [generator function](http://exploringjs.com/es6/ch_generators.html) (denoted by the `*` in the function name) gets paused on statements called by `yield` - until the yielded statement returns. `yield takeEvery([ACTION_NAME], callback)` executes the provided callback [every time the related action is called](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/basics/UsingSagaHelpers.html). To summarize, this will execute `commentApproveFailure` when the fetch initiated by `commentApprove()` fails.

As for `commentApproveFailure`, it just dispatch a [`call`](https://redux-saga.js.org/docs/api/#callfn-args) side effect to the `captureException` function from the global `Raven` object.

To use this saga, pass it in the `customSagas` props of the `<Admin>` component:

```jsx
// in src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';

import { CommentList } from './comments';
import commentSaga from './comments/commentSaga';

const App = () => (

With this code, a failed review approval now sends the the correct signal to Sentry.

**Tip**:  The side effects are [testable](https://redux-saga.github.io/redux-saga/docs/introduction/BeginnerTutorial.html#making-our-code-testable), too.

## Using a Custom Reducer

In addition to triggering REST calls, you may want to store the effect of your own actions in the application state. For instance, if you want to display a widget showing the current exchange rate for the bitcoin, you might need the following action:

```jsx
// in src/bitcoinRateReceived.js
export const BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED = 'BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED';
export const bitcoinRateReceived = (rate) => ({
    type: BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED,
    payload: { rate },
});
```

This action can be triggered on mount by the following component:

```jsx
// in src/BitCoinRate.js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import { bitcoinRateReceived as bitcoinRateReceivedAction } from './bitcoinRateReceived';

class BitCoinRate extends Component {
    componentWillMount() {
        fetch('https://blockchain.info/fr/ticker')
            .then(response => response.json())
            .then(rates => rates.USD['15m'])
            .then(bitcoinRateReceived) // dispatch action when the response is received
    }

    render() {
        const { rate } = this.props;
        return <div>Current bitcoin value: {rate}$</div>
    }
}

BitCoinRate.propTypes = {
    bitcoinRateReceived: PropTypes.func,
    rate: PropTypes.number,
};

const mapStateToProps = state => ({ rate: state.bitcoinRate });

export default connect(mapStateToProps, {
    bitcoinRateReceived: bitcoinRateReceivedAction,
})(BitCoinRate);
```

In order to put the rate passed to `bitcoinRateReceived()` into the Redux store, you'll need a reducer:

```jsx
// in src/rateReducer.js
import { BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED } from './bitcoinRateReceived';

export default (previousState = 0, { type, payload }) => {
    if (type === BITCOIN_RATE_RECEIVED) {
        return payload.rate;
    }
    return previousState;
}
```

Now the question is: How can you put this reducer in the `<Admin>` app? Simple: use the `customReducers` props:

{% raw %}
```jsx
// in src/App.js
import React from 'react';
import { Admin } from 'react-admin';

import rate from './rateReducer';

const App = () => (
    <Admin customReducers={{ rate }} dataProvider={jsonServerProvider('http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com')}>
        ...
    </Admin>
);

export default App;
```
{% endraw %}

**Tip**: You can avoid storing data in the Redux state by storing data in a component state instead. It's much less complicated to deal with, and more performant, too. Use the global state only when you really need to.

## List Bulk Actions

Almost everything we saw before about custom actions is true for custom `List` bulk actions too, with the following few differences:

* Bulk action components receive the following props: `resource`, `selectedIds` and `filterValues`
* They do not receive the current record in the `record` prop as there are many of them.
* They must render as a material-ui [`MenuItem`](http://www.material-ui.com/#/components/menu).

You can find a complete example of a custom Bulk Action button in the `List` documentation, in the [`bulk-actions`](/List.html#bulk-actions) section.

## Conclusion

Which style should you choose for your own action buttons?

The first version (with `fetch`) is perfectly fine, and if you're not into unit testing your components, or decoupling side effects from pure functions, then you can stick with it without problem.

On the other hand, if you want to promote reusability, separation of concerns, adhere to react-admin's coding standards, and if you know enough Redux and Saga, use the final version.
