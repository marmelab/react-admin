# Remix Integration

[Remix](https://remix.run/) is a Node.js framework for server-side-rendered React apps. But even if react-admin is designed to build Single-Page Applications, Remix and react-admin integrate seamlessly. 

## Setting Up Remix

Let's start by creating a new Remix project. Run the following command:

```sh
npx create-remix@latest
```

This script will ask you for more details about your project. You can use the following options:

- The name you want to give to your project, e.g. `remix-supabase-react-admin`
- "Just the basics"
- "Remix App Server"
- "TypeScript"
- "Run npm install"

The project structure should look something like this:

![Remix project structure](./img/remix-structure.png)

## Setting Up React-Admin In Remix

Add the `react-admin` npm package, as well as a data provider package. In this example, we'll use `ra-data-json-server` to connect to a test API provided by [JSONPlaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com).

```sh
cd remix-supabase-react-admin
npm add react-admin ra-data-json-server
```
**Tip**: If you're using yarn, Remix and react-admin both install `react-router`, and due to the way each library handles its dependency, this results in duplicate packages. To avoid this, use [yarn resolutions](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions/) to force Remix to use the same version of `react-router` as react-admin. So add the following to the `package.json` file:

```js
{
  // ...
  "resolutions": {
    "react-router": "6.8.1",
    "react-router-dom": "6.8.1"
  }
}
```

And call `yarn` again to install the dependencies:

```sh
yarn
```

Next, create the admin app component in `app/components/App.tsx`:

```jsx
// in app/components/App.tsx
import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from "react-admin";
import jsonServerProvider from "ra-data-json-server";

const dataProvider = jsonServerProvider("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");

const App = () => (
  <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>
    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} />
    <Resource name="comments" list={ListGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

This is a minimal admin for 2 resources. React-admin should be able to render a list of posts and a list of comments, guessing the data structure from the API response. 

## Remix v1

This section is for projects using [the current routing file conventions (v1)](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/routes-files).

### Using React-Admin As The Root Application

If you want to serve the admin app component in the root path ('/'), edit the file called `routes/index.tsx`, and replace the content with the following:

```jsx
// in app/routes/index.tsx
import App from "../components/App";
import styles from "~/styles/app.css";

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
}

export default App;
```

The stylesheet link is necessary to reset the default styles of the admin app. Create it in `app/styles/app.css`:

```css
body { margin: 0; }
```

Remix and react-admin both use [react-router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing. React-admin detects when it is included inside an existing React Router context and reuses it. This is problematic because Remix uses file-based routing. So when react-admin changes the route to `/posts` for instance, Remix will look for a corresponding `app/routes/posts.tsx` file. As it doesn't exist, Remix will render a 404.

The solution is to create a [splat route](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#splat-routes), i.e. a route that matches all URLs. A splat route is named `$.tsx`. Duplicate the `app/routes/index.tsx` code into the `app/routes/$.tsx` file:

```jsx
// in app/routes/$.tsx
import App from "../components/App";
import styles from "~/styles/app.css";

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
}

export default App;
```

**Tip**: Remix doesn't let splat routes catch requests to the index page ('/'), so you must have both the `app/routes/index.tsx` and `app/routes/$.tsx` routes to correctly render the admin app.

Now, start the server with `npm run dev`, browse to `http://localhost:3000/`, and you should see the working admin:

![Working Page](./img/nextjs-react-admin.webp)

### Rendering React-Admin In A Sub Route

In many cases, the admin is only a part of the application. For instance, you may want to render the admin in a subpath like `/admin`.

To do so, add a [splat route](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/api/conventions#splat-routes), i.e. a route that matches all URLs inside a sub path. A splat route is named `$.tsx`. Create a file called `app/routes/admin/$.tsx` file with the following content:

```jsx
// in app/routes/$.tsx
import App from "../../components/App";
import styles from "~/styles/app.css";

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
}

export default App;
```

The stylesheet link is necessary to reset the default styles of the admin app. Create it in `app/styles/app.css`:

```css
body { margin: 0; }
```

And finally, update the react-admin app to specify the `<Admin basename>` prop, so that react-admin generates links relative to the "/admin" subpath:

```diff
// in app/components/App.tsx
import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from "react-admin";
import jsonServerProvider from "ra-data-json-server";

const dataProvider = jsonServerProvider("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com");

const App = () => (
- <Admin dataProvider={dataProvider}>
+ <Admin basename="/admin" dataProvider={dataProvider}>
    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} />
    <Resource name="comments" list={ListGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

Now the admin renders at `http://localhost:3000/admin`, and you can use the Remix routing system to add more pages.

### Adding an API

[Remix allows to serve an API](https://remix.run/docs/en/v1/guides/api-routes) from the same server. You *could* use this to build a CRUD API by hand. However, we consider that building a CRUD API on top of a relational database is a solved problem and that developers shouldn't spend time reimplementing it. 

For instance, if you store your data in a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, you can use [PostgREST](https://postgrest.org/en/stable/) to expose the data as a REST API with zero configuration. Even better, you can use a Software-as-a-Service like [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to do that for you. 

In such cases, the Remix API can only serve as a Proxy to authenticate client queries and pass them down to Supabase. 

Let's see an example in practice. 

First, create a Supabase REST API and its associated PostgreSQL database directly on the [Supabase website](https://app.supabase.com/) (it's free for tests and low usage). Once the setup is finished, use the Supabase manager to add the following tables:

- `posts` with fields: `id`, `title`, and `body` 
- `comments` with fields: `id`, `name`, `body`, and `postId` (a foreign key to the `posts.id` field)

You can populate these tables via the Supabse UI if you want. Supabase exposes a REST API at `https://YOUR_INSTANCE.supabase.co/rest/v1`.

Next, create a configuration to let the Remix app connect to Supabase. As Remix supports [`dotenv`](https://dotenv.org/) by default in `development` mode, you just need to create a `.env` file:

```sh
# In `.env`
SUPABASE_URL="https://MY_INSTANCE.supabase.co"
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE="MY_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
```

**Tip**: This example uses the **service role key** here and not the anonymous role. This allows mutations without dealing with authorization. **You shouldn't do this in production**, but use the [Supabase authorization](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth) feature instead.

Time to bootstrap the API Proxy. Create a new Remix route at `app/routes/admin/api/$.tsx`. Inside this file, a `loader` function should convert the GET requests into Supabase API calls, and an `action` function should do the same for POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.

```jsx
// in app/routes/admin/api/$.tsx
import type { ActionFunction, LoaderFunction } from '@remix-run/node';

// handle read requests (getOne, getList, getMany, getManyReference) 
export const loader: LoaderFunction = ({ request }) => {
    const apiUrl = getSupabaseUrlFromRequestUrl(request.url);

    return fetch(apiUrl, {
        headers: {
            prefer: request.headers.get('prefer') ?? '',
            accept: request.headers.get('accept') ?? 'application/json',
            apiKey: `${process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE}`,
            Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE}`,
        },
    });
};

// handle write requests (create, update, delete, updateMany, deleteMany)
export const action: ActionFunction = ({ request }) => {
    const apiUrl = getSupabaseUrlFromRequestUrl(request.url);

    return fetch(apiUrl, {
        method: request.method,
        body: request.body,
        headers: {
            prefer: request.headers.get('prefer') ?? '',
            accept: request.headers.get('accept') ?? 'application/json',
            'apiKey': `${process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE}`,
            'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE}`,
        }
    });
}

const ADMIN_PREFIX = "/admin/api";

const getSupabaseUrlFromRequestUrl = (url: string) => {
  const startOfRequest = url.indexOf(ADMIN_PREFIX);
  const query = url.substring(startOfRequest + ADMIN_PREFIX.length);
  return `${process.env.SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1${query}`;
};
```

**Tip**: Some of this code is really PostgREST-specific. The `prefer` header is required to let PostgREST return one record instead of an array containing one record in response to `getOne` requests. A proxy for another CRUD API will require different parameters.

Finally, update the react-admin data provider to use the Supabase adapter instead of the JSON Server one. As Supabase provides a PostgREST endpoint, we'll use [`ra-data-postgrest`](https://github.com/raphiniert-com/ra-data-postgrest):

```sh
npm add @raphiniert/ra-data-postgrest
```

```jsx
// in app/components/App.tsx
import { Admin, Resource, ListGuesser } from 'react-admin';
import postgrestRestProvider from "@raphiniert/ra-data-postgrest";

const dataProvider = postgrestRestProvider("/admin/api");

const App = () => (
  <Admin basename="/admin" dataProvider={dataProvider}>
    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} />
    <Resource name="comments" list={ListGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

That's it! Now Remix both renders the admin app and serves as a proxy to the Supabase API. You can test the app by visiting `http://localhost:3000/admin`, and the API Proxy by visiting `http://localhost:3000/admin/api/posts`.

Note that the Supabase credentials never leave the server. It's up to you to add your own authentication to the API proxy. 

## Remix v2

This section is for projects using [the new routing file conventions (v2)](https://remix.run/docs/en/main/file-conventions/route-files-v2).

### Using React-Admin As The Root Application

If you want to serve the admin app component in the root path ('/'), edit the file called `_routes/index.tsx`, and replace the content with the following:

```jsx
// in app/routes/_index.tsx
import App from "../components/App";
import styles from "~/styles/app.css";

export function links() {
  return [{ rel: "stylesheet", href: styles }];
}

export default App;
```

The stylesheet link is necessary to reset the default styles of the admin app. Create it in `app/styles/app.css`:

```css
body { margin: 0; }
```

    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} />
    <Resource name="comments" list={ListGuesser} />

);

    });
}

const ADMIN_PREFIX = "/admin/api";

const getSupabaseUrlFromRequestUrl = (url: string) => {
  const startOfRequest = url.indexOf(ADMIN_PREFIX);
  const query = url.substring(startOfRequest + ADMIN_PREFIX.length);
  return `${process.env.SUPABASE_URL}/rest/v1${query}`;
};

    <Resource name="posts" list={ListGuesser} />
    <Resource name="comments" list={ListGuesser} />
  </Admin>
);

export default App;
```

That's it! Now Remix both renders the admin app and serves as a proxy to the Supabase API. You can test the app by visiting `http://localhost:3000/admin`, and the API Proxy by visiting `http://localhost:3000/admin/api/posts`.

Note that the Supabase credentials never leave the server. It's up to you to add your own authentication to the API proxy.
