# Real-Time Updates And Locks

Teams where several people work in parallel on a common task need to allow live updates, real-time notifications, and prevent data loss when two editors work on the same resource concurrently.

React-admin offers powerful realtime features to help you build collaborative applications, based on the Publish / Subscribe (PubSub) pattern. The [Realtime documentation](./Realtime.md) explains how to use them.

These features are part of the [Enterprise Edition](https://marmelab.com/ra-enterprise)<img class="icon" src="./img/premium.svg" />.

## Realtime Data Provider

The realtime features are backend agnostic. Just like for CRUD operations,realtime operations rely on the data provider, using additional methods:

- `dataProvider.subscribe(topic, callback)`
- `dataProvider.unsubscribe(topic, callback)`
- `dataProvider.publish(topic, event)` (optional - publication is often done server-side)

In addition, to support the lock features, the `dataProvider` must implement 4 more methods:

- `dataProvider.lock(resource, { id, identity, meta })`
- `dataProvider.unlock(resource, { id, identity, meta })`
- `dataProvider.getLock(resource, { id, meta })`
- `dataProvider.getLocks(resource, { meta })`

You can implement these features using any realtime backend, including:

- [Mercure](https://mercure.rocks/),
- [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/docs/admin/real-time-mercure/#real-time-updates-with-mercure),
- [supabase](https://supabase.com/),
- [Socket.IO](https://socket.io/),
- [Ably](https://ably.com/),
- and many more.

Check the [Realtime Data Provider documentation](./RealtimeDataProvider.md) for more information, and for helpers to build your own realtime data provider.
