## Reporting a Bug

If you think you've found a bug, please [open an issue on the GitHub repository](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues).

Make sure you follow the issue template and provide a way to reproduce the bug. The more information you provide, the easier it is for us to fix it.

Please note that we don't provide support via GitHub issues - use them only for bug reports.

## Contributing

If you want to give a hand: Thank you! There are many things you can do to help make react-admin better.

The easiest task is **bug triaging**. Check that new issues on GitHub follow the issue template and give a way to reproduce the issue. If not, comment on the issue to ask for precisions. Then, try and reproduce the issue following the description. If you managed to reproduce the issue, add a comment to say it. Otherwise, add a comment to say that something is missing.

The second way to contribute is to **answer support questions on [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/react-admin) and [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/830711057643208724/1022443113391853578)**. There are many beginner questions there, so even if you're not super experienced with react-admin, your contribution will be appreciated.

Pull requests for **bug fixes** are welcome on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin). There is always a bunch of [issues labeled "Good First Issue"](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) in the bug tracker - start with these.

If you want to **add a feature**, you can open a Pull request on the `next` branch. We don't accept all features - we try to keep the react-admin code small and manageable. Try and see if your feature can't be built as an additional `npm` package. If you're in doubt, open a "Feature Request" issue to see if the core team would accept your feature before developing it.

For all Pull requests, you must follow the coding style of the existing files (based on [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)), and include unit tests and documentation. Be prepared for a thorough code review, and be patient for the merge - this is an open-source initiative.

**Tip**: Most of the commands used by the react-admin developers are automated in the `makefile`. Feel free to type `make` without argument to see a list of the available commands.
