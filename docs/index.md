# react-admin

A frontend Framework for building admin applications running in the browser on top of REST/GraphQL APIs, using ES6, [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Material Design](https://material.io/). Previously named [admin-on-rest](https://github.com/marmelab/admin-on-rest). Open sourced and maintained by [marmelab](https://marmelab.com/).

## Features

* Adapts to any backend (REST, GraphQL, SOAP, etc.)
* Complete documentation
* Super-fast UI thanks to optimistic rendering (renders before the server returns)
* Undo updates and deletes for a few seconds
* Supports relationships (many to one, one to many)
* Internationalization (i18n)
* Conditional formatting
* Themeable
* Supports any authentication provider (REST API, OAuth, Basic Auth, ...)
* Full-featured Datagrid (sort, pagination, filters)
* Filter-as-you-type
* Supports any form layout (simple, tabbed, etc.)
* Data Validation
* Custom actions
* Large library of components for various data types: boolean, number, rich text, etc.
* WYSIWYG editor
* Customize dashboard, menu, layout
* Super easy to extend and override (it's just React components)
* Highly customizable interface
* Can connect to multiple backends
* Leverages the best libraries in the React ecosystem (Redux, redux-form, redux-saga, material-ui, recompose)
* Can be included in another React app
* Inspired by the popular [ng-admin](https://github.com/marmelab/ng-admin) library (also by marmelab)

## Installation

React-admin is available from npm. You can install it (and its required dependencies)
using:

```sh
npm install react-admin
```

## Usage

Read the [Tutorial](./Tutorial.md) for a 30 minutes introduction. After that, head to the [Documentation](./index.md), or checkout the [source code of the demo](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin/tree/master/examples/demo) for an example usage.

## At a Glance

```jsx
// in app.js
import React from 'react';
import { render } from 'react-dom';
import { Admin, Resource } from 'react-admin';
import simpleRestProvider from 'ra-data-simple-rest';

import { PostList, PostEdit, PostCreate, PostIcon } from './posts';

render(
    <Admin dataProvider={simpleRestProvider('http://localhost:3000')}>
        <Resource name="posts" list={PostList} edit={PostEdit} create={PostCreate} icon={PostIcon}/>
    </Admin>,
    document.getElementById('root')
);
```

The `<Resource>` component is a configuration component that allows to define sub components for each of the admin view: `list`, `edit`, and `create`. These components use Material UI and custom components from react-admin:

{% raw %}
```jsx
// in posts.js
import React from 'react';
import { List, Datagrid, Edit, Create, SimpleForm, DateField, TextField, EditButton, DisabledInput, TextInput, LongTextInput, DateInput } from 'react-admin';
import BookIcon from '@material-ui/icons/Book';
export const PostIcon = BookIcon;

export const PostList = (props) => (
    <List {...props}>
        <Datagrid>
            <TextField source="id" />
            <TextField source="title" />
            <DateField source="published_at" />
            <TextField source="average_note" />
            <TextField source="views" />
            <EditButton basePath="/posts" />
        </Datagrid>
    </List>
);

const PostTitle = ({ record }) => {
    return <span>Post {record ? `"${record.title}"` : ''}</span>;
};

export const PostEdit = (props) => (
    <Edit title={<PostTitle />} {...props}>
        <SimpleForm>
            <DisabledInput source="id" />
            <TextInput source="title" />
            <TextInput source="teaser" options={{ multiLine: true }} />
            <LongTextInput source="body" />
            <DateInput label="Publication date" source="published_at" />
            <TextInput source="average_note" />
            <DisabledInput label="Nb views" source="views" />
        </SimpleForm>
    </Edit>
);

export const PostCreate = (props) => (
    <Create title="Create a Post" {...props}>
        <SimpleForm>
            <TextInput source="title" />
            <TextInput source="teaser" options={{ multiLine: true }} />
            <LongTextInput source="body" />
            <TextInput label="Publication date" source="published_at" />
            <TextInput source="average_note" />
        </SimpleForm>
    </Create>
);
```
{% endraw %}

## Does It Work With My API?

Yes.

React-admin uses an adapter approach, with a concept called *Data Providers*. Existing providers can be used as a blueprint to design your API, or you can write your own Data Provider to query an existing API. Writing a custom Data Provider is a matter of hours.

See the [Data Providers documentation](./DataProviders.md) for details.

## Batteries Included But Removable

React-admin is designed as a library of loosely coupled React components built on top of [material-ui](http://www.material-ui.com/#/), in addition to controller functions implemented the Redux way. It is very easy to replace one part of react-admin with your own, e.g. to use a custom datagrid, GraphQL instead of REST, or bootstrap instead of Material Design.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/marmelab/react-admin). Try to follow the coding style of the existing files, and include unit tests and documentation. Be prepared for a thorough code review, and be patient for the merge - this is an open-source initiative.

You can run the example app by calling:

```sh
make run
```

And then browse to [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).

If you want to contribute to the documentation, install jekyll, then call

```sh
make doc
```

And then browse to [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/)

You can run the unit tests by calling

```sh
make test
```

If you are using react-admin as a dependency, and if you want to try and hack it, here is the advised process:

```sh
# in myapp
# install react-admin from GitHub in another directory
$ cd ..
$ git clone git@github.com:marmelab/react-admin.git && cd react-admin && make install
# replace your node_modules/react-admin by a symbolic link to the github checkout
$ cd ../myapp
$ npm link ../react-admin
# go back to the checkout, and replace the version of react by the one in your app
$ cd ../react-admin
$ npm link ../myapp/node_modules/react
$ make watch
# in another terminal, go back to your app, and start it as usual
$ cd ../myapp
$ npm run
```
