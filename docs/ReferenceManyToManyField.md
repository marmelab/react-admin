# `<ReferenceManyToManyField>`

This [Enterprise Edition](https://marmelab.com/ra-enterprise)<img class="icon" src="./img/premium.svg" /> component fetches a list of referenced records by lookup in an associative table, and passes the records down to its child component, which must be an iterator component (e.g. `<SingleFieldList>`).

Note: The `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` cannot currently display multiple records with the same id from the end reference resource, even though they might have different properties in the associative table.

## Usage

Let's imagine that you're writing an app managing concerts for artists. The data model features a many-to-many relationship between the `bands` and `venues` tables through a `performances` associative table.

```
┌─────────┐       ┌──────────────┐      ┌───────────────┐
│ bands   │       │ performances │      │ venues        │
│---------│       │--------------│      │---------------│
│ id      │───┐   │ id           │   ┌──│ id            │
│ name    │   └──╼│ band_id      │   │  │ name          │
│         │       │ venue_id     │╾──┘  │ location      │
│         │       │ date         │      │               │
└─────────┘       └──────────────┘      └───────────────┘
```

In this example, `bands.id` matches `performances.band_id`, and `performances.venue_id` matches `venues.id`.

To allow users see the `venues` for a given `band` in `<SingleFieldList>`, wrap that component in `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` where you define the relationship via the `reference`, `through` and `using` props: 

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Show, SimpleShowLayout, TextField, DateField, SingleFieldList, ChipField } from 'react-admin';
import { ReferenceManyToManyField } from '@react-admin/ra-relationships';

export const BandShow = () => (
    <Show>
        <SimpleShowLayout>
            <TextField source="name" />
            <ReferenceManyToManyField
                reference="venues"
                through="performances"
                using="band_id,venue_id"
                label="Performances"
            >
                <SingleFieldList>
                    <ChipField source="name" />
                </SingleFieldList>
            </ReferenceManyToManyField>
            <EditButton />
        </SimpleShowLayout>
    </Show>
);
```

The iterator element usually has one or more child `<Field>` components.                                                                          |

The tuple should start with the field pointing to the resource, and finish with the field pointing to the reference |

## `children`

`<ReferenceManyToManyField>` expects an _iterator_ component as child, i.e. a component working inside a `ListContext`. 

This means you can use a `<Datagrid>` instead of a `<SingleFieldList>`, which is useful if you want to display more details about related records. For instance, to display the venue `name` and `location`:

```diff
export const BandShow = () => (
    <Show>
        <SimpleShowLayout>
           <TextField source="name" />
            <ReferenceManyToManyField
                reference="venues"
                through="performances"
                using="band_id,venue_id"
                label="Performances"
            >
-               <SingleFieldList>
-                   <ChipField source="name" />
-               </SingleFieldList>
+               <Datagrid>
+                   <TextField source="name" />
+                   <TextField source="location" />
+               </Datagrid>
            </ReferenceManyToManyField>
            <EditButton />
        </SimpleShowLayout>
    </Show>
);
```

## `filter`

You can filter the records of the associative table (e.g. `performances`) using the `filter` prop. This `filter` is passed to the `getManyReference()` call.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
    filter={{ date: '2018-08-31' }}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```
{% endraw %}

## `joinLimit`

By default, react-admin fetches 100 entries in the join table (e.g. `performances`). You can decrease or increase the number of entries fetched from the associative table by modifying the `joinLimit` prop:

```tsx
import { Pagination } from 'react-admin';

<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
    joinLimit={50}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## `perPage`

By default, react-admin displays at most 25 entries from the associative table (e.g. 25 `performances`). You can change the limit by setting the `perPage` prop:

```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
    perPage={10}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

**Note**: You can add a pagination system by adding the `<Pagination>` component to the `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` children:

```tsx
import { Pagination } from 'react-admin';

<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
    perPage={10}
>
    {/* ... */}
    <Pagination />
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## `reference`

The name of the target resource to fetch.

For instance, if you want to display the `venues` of a given `bands`, through `performances`, the `reference` name should be `venues`:

```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    source="id"
    reference="venues"
    resource="bands"
    through="performances"
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## `sort`

By default, react-admin orders the possible values by `id` desc for the associative table (e.g. `performances`). You can change this order by setting the `sort` prop (an object with `field` and `order` properties) to be applied to the associative resource.

{% raw %}
```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
    sort={{ field: 'id', order: 'DESC' }}
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```
{% endraw %}

## `source`

By default, `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` uses the `id` field as target for the reference. If the foreign key points to another field of your record, you can select it with the `source` prop

```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    source="_id"
    reference="venues"
    resource="bands"
    through="performances"
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## `through`

You must specify the associative table name using the `through` prop.

```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField reference="venues" through="performances">
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## `using`

You can specify the columns to use in the associative `using` the using prop.

```tsx
<ReferenceManyToManyField
    reference="venues"
    through="performances"
    using="band_id,venue_id"
>
    {/* ... */}
</ReferenceManyToManyField>
```

## DataProvider Calls

`<ReferenceManyToManyField>` fetches the `dataProvider` twice in a row:

-   once to get the records of the associative resource (`performances` in this case), using a `getManyReference()` call
-   once to get the records of the reference resource (`venues` in this case), using a `getMany()` call.

For instance, if the user displays the band of id `123`, `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` first issues the following query to the `dataProvider`:

```js
dataProvider.getManyReference('performances', {
    target: 'band_id',
    id: 123,
});
```

Let's say that the `dataProvider` returns the following response:

```json
{
    "data": [
        { "id": 667, "band_id": 123, "venue_id": 732 },
        { "id": 895, "band_id": 123, "venue_id": 874 }
        { "id": 901, "band_id": 123, "venue_id": 756 }
    ],
    "total": 3
}
```

Then, `<ReferenceManyToManyField>` issues a second query to the `dataProvider`:

```js
dataProvider.getMany('venues', {
    ids: [732, 874, 756],
});
```

And receives the reference venues:

```json
{
    "data": [
        { "id": 732, "name": "Madison Square Garden" },
        { "id": 874, "name": "Yankee Stadium" }
        { "id": 874, "name": "Barclays Center" }
    ],
    "total": 3
}
```
