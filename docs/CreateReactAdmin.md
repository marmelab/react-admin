# `create-react-admin`

This CLI generates a new react-admin application using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Use it by running the following command:

```sh
npx create react-admin@latest your-admin-name
# or
yarn create react-admin your-admin-name
```

It will then ask you to choose:
- a data provider
- a auth provider
- the names of the resources to add
- the package manager to use to install the dependencies
