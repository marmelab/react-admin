# Upgrading to v5

## `<Datagrid rowClick>` is no longer `false` by default

`<Datagrid>` will now make the rows clickable as soon as a Show or Edit view is declared on the resource (using the [resource definition](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/Resource.html)).

If you previously relied on the fact that the rows were not clickable by default, you now need to explicitly disable the `rowClick` feature:

```diff
-<Datagrid>
+<Datagrid rowClick={false}>
   ...
</Datagrid>
```

## Dark Theme Is Available By Default

In addition to the light theme, React-admin v5 includes a [dark theme](https://marmelab.com/react-admin/AppTheme.html#light-and-dark-themes), renders a theme switcher in the app bar, and chooses the default theme based on the user OS preferences.

If you don't need the dark mode feature, you'll have to explicitly disable it:

```diff
-<Admin>
+<Admin darkTheme={null}>
   ...
</Admin>
```

## Links are now underlined by default

In the default theme, links are now underlined by default.

If you use the `<Link>` component from `react-admin`, and you want to remove the underline, set the `underline` prop to `none`:

```diff
import { Link } from 'react-admin';

const MyComponent = () => (
-   <Link to="/foo">Foo</Link>
+   <Link to="/foo" underline="none">Foo</Link>
);
```

Some react-admin component use `<Link>` under the hood, and will also render underlined links:

- `<Count>`
- `<EmailField>`
- `<FileField>`
- `<ReferenceField>`
- `<ReferenceManyCount>`
- `<UrlField>`

`<SingleFieldList>` still disables the underline by default.

To remove the underline in these components, use the `sx` prop. For instance, to remove the underline in `<ReferenceField>`:

{% raw %}
```diff
const CompanyField = () => (
-   <ReferenceField source="company_id" reference="companies" />
+   <ReferenceField source="company_id" reference="companies" sx={{
+      '& a': { textDecoration: 'none' }
+   }} />
)
```
{% endraw %}
